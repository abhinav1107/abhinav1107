# 👋🏻 Hello, I am Abhinav

I am a passionate DevOps engineer with a mission to automate everything. My expertise lies in:
- **DevOps Practices:** Implement best practices for continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment.
- **Containerization:** Create scalable and portable applications using Docker / Kubernetes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Using tools like Terraform and Ansible to define and manage infrastructure.
- **Cloud Technologies:** Proficient in cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP.

I occasionally write about DevOps, automation, and technology on [my blog](https://abhinav.ltd). You can also find me here: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinav1107/) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abhinav1107)
