# Hi, I'm Abhinav 👋🏻

### Senior DevOps Architect | SRE | Platform Engineer

**Infrastructure. Automation. Reliability. GitOps.**

I design, build, and operate scalable cloud-native platforms using Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GitOps, and strong observability practices. My focus is on reliability, simplicity, and automation – treating infrastructure as a product, not just a collection of scripts.

---

## What I Work On

The kind of work I do and enjoy:
- Designing and running Kubernetes-based platforms
- Building GitOps-driven delivery workflows using Helm, ArgoCD ApplicationSets, and CI/CD pipelines
- Setting up observability stacks with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, exporters, and alerting rules
- Automating infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible in multi-account, multi-environment setups
- Experimenting in a home lab with open source tools and other “production-like” systems

## Types of Systems I've Designed and Built

Without going into company-specific details, these are representative examples of the kind of work I’ve done:

- Multi-tenant EKS platforms using ArgoCD, Helm, and S3-backed chart repositories
- Kafka clusters (Strimzi-based and managed) monitored with Prometheus, Kafka/JMX exporters, and Grafana
- End-to-end observability stacks (metrics, logs, alerts) for microservice architectures
- CI/CD pipelines for containerized applications with automated testing, security scanning, and progressive delivery
- Lab environments that replicate production environments: Zabbix for infra monitoring, SNMP/NetFlow simulation, Loki for logs, Kubernetes Cluster using k3s

Topics usually include Kubernetes, GitOps, observability, Kafka, and practical SRE-style problem-solving.

### A Bit About How I Work

Engineer by profession, tinkerer by nature. I enjoy breaking things, understanding them deeply, and putting them back together cleaner, faster, and more automated.

I’m always open to good conversations about infrastructure, reliability, and practical DevOps.
